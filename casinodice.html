<!--At casino dice, we don't tell you which dice game to play or how to play it. The decision as to which path to take is entirely up to you. 
    We are merely serving as a randomizer. Simply conceive of a game you'd like to play and then roll the dice to see if you win or lose.
    Its easy to do, just hit reload on the browser to roll the dice. This is still a work in progress, working on a way to add wage bets
    as you can see with wage bets option. Have fun and enjoy. -->
